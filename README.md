    Welcome to the VexAI project! An ever-evolving artificial intelligence project since 2019. Initially developed as an Android app in Java, I faced challenges implementing advanced machine learning features. 
  <br><br>
    
 This is the mobile version of Vex made with Java. All features are done natively. Check our main project, there is no guarantee that this version will always be up to date

   Note: Vex is under active development. Stay tuned for future updates! 
  
   The Vex AI is currently hosted on Netlify. You can try it out (under construction) by saying "hi" to her ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
